## Issues Encountered and Resolutions

### 1. Handling Missing Values
- **Problem**: Missing values were present in several columns, causing errors during data manipulation and model training.
- **Solution**:
  - For **numeric columns**, missing values were filled using the column mean.
  - For **categorical columns**, missing values were filled with the mode (most frequent value).
  - **Code**:
    ```python
    train_data.fillna(train_data.mean(), inplace=True)
    train_data[categorical_cols] = train_data[categorical_cols].fillna(train_data[categorical_cols].mode().iloc[0])
    ```

### 2. Non-Numeric Data in Correlation Matrix
- **Problem**: Attempting to compute the correlation matrix on the entire dataset resulted in errors because non-numeric columns could not be processed.
- **Solution**: We filtered out the non-numeric columns and computed the correlation matrix only for numeric columns.
  - **Code**:
    ```python
    numeric_data = train_data.select_dtypes(include=['float64', 'int64'])
    corr_matrix = numeric_data.corr()
    ```

### 3. Feature Mismatch Between Train and Test Data
- **Problem**: The test dataset contained columns not present in the training dataset, causing prediction errors.
- **Solution**: The train and test datasets were aligned to ensure the columns were consistent across both sets.
  - **Code**:
    ```python
    X_train, test_data_aligned = X_train.align(test_data_cleaned, join='inner', axis=1)
    ```

### 4. Incorrect Inclusion of `Id` Column During Model Training
- **Problem**: The `Id` column, which should not be used for training, was included in the model training, causing issues during prediction.
- **Solution**: The model was re-trained after excluding the `Id` column.
  - **Code**:
    ```python
    X_train = X_train.drop(columns=['Id'], errors='ignore')
    model.fit(X_train, y_train)
    ```

---

### 5. Missing `scikit-learn` Library
- **Problem**: The required library `scikit-learn` was not installed, causing errors when attempting to use `train_test_split` and other modeling functions.
- **Solution**: The library was installed using pip.
  - **Code**:
    ```bash
    !pip install scikit-learn
    ```

---

### 6. Feature Mismatch During Prediction
- **Problem**: There was a feature mismatch when making predictions because the test set had different feature names compared to the training set.
- **Solution**: The datasets were properly aligned to ensure that the features used for training and prediction were identical.
  - **Code**:
    ```python
    X_train, test_data_aligned = X_train.align(test_data_cleaned, join='inner', axis=1)
    ```

---

## Key Takeaways
- **Data Alignment**: Ensuring consistent columns between the train and test datasets is crucial to avoid feature mismatch errors.
- **Feature Selection**: Exclude non-predictive columns (like `Id`) during model training to prevent unwanted errors.
- **Debugging**: Pay attention to error messagesâ€”they often indicate the source of the problem and provide actionable insights for resolution.
